<p align="center">Research-Based Digital Signature Authentication: An Alternative to Password-Based Authentication with Integration Capabilities</p>

## Introduction

**DrawKey** is an innovative authentication solution designed to address the challenges associated with traditional password-based authentication methods. Instead of relying on complex passwords that are often difficult to remember and manage, DrawKey allows users to authenticate themselves through handwritten signatures or drawings.

By leveraging the unique characteristics of each user's signature or drawing, DrawKey aims to provide a more secure and user-friendly alternative to passwords. This project explores the development of the DrawKey system, including the design, implementation, and integration capabilities.

## Research Documentation

Our research findings and documentation are available below. We are actively conducting research in parallel with the development of the DrawKey system. This documentation provides in-depth insights into our research methodology, findings, and progress.
